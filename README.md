#  2025 Notre Dame Data Chemistry Boot Camp

This repository hosts interactive tutorials designed for chemists to explore how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can support chemical reasoning, data access, and literature review.

---

##  Sessions Overview

1. **Designing Chemistry Questions for AI**  
   - Learn how LLMs respond to chemistry prompts.  
   - Exercise: write and refine your own prompts.  

2. **Making AI Answers More Reliable (RAG with PDFs)**  
   - Why LLMs hallucinate and how RAG helps.  
   - Demo: upload a PDF and ground AI answers in it.  

3. **Web-Based RAG with PubChem**  
   - Use the PubChem API to fetch real molecular data.  
   - Show how LLMs integrate external chemical knowledge.  

4. **AI-Generated Structured Reports**  
   - Automatically generate structured comparison/summary reports.  
   - Export results to PDF.  

5. **AI-Assisted Literature Reviews**  
   - Draft mini literature reviews.  
   - Produce outlines, expand into drafts, and export to PDF.
